NON-LINEAR PATTERNS ANALYSIS RESULTS
================================================================================

MOTIVATION:
----------------------------------------
Random Forest outperforms Logistic Regression (89.64% vs 88.78%),
suggesting the presence of non-linear relationships in the data.

KEY FINDINGS:
----------------------------------------
1. FEATURE INTERACTIONS:
   1. TrigramSurprisal × InformationStatus: Synergy = 0.187
   2. TrigramSurprisal × DependencyLength: Synergy = 0.147
   3. InformationStatus × Case MarkerTransitions: Synergy = 0.115
   4. TrigramSurprisal × Case MarkerTransitions: Synergy = 0.115
   5. TrigramSurprisal × Positional LM: Synergy = 0.106

2. POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION RESULTS:
   Degree 1: 88.80% with 5 features
   Degree 2: 88.79% with 20 features
   Degree 3: 89.21% with 55 features

3. NON-LINEAR PATTERNS:
   - Partial dependence plots show non-monotonic relationships
   - Threshold effects observed in dependency length at extreme values
   - Saturation effects in surprisal measures at high values

4. IMPLICATIONS:
   - Linear models may underestimate effects at extreme feature values
   - Complex interactions between features contribute to predictive power
   - Non-linearities align with cognitive processing theories
